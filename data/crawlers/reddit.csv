0,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,87,m16uon,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,27,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption üëá

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ‚¨áÔ∏è

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",1615326884.0,2021-03-09,21:54:44

10,"What are the changes needed to bitcoin core needed for job negotiation? I wouldn't have thought any protocol change would be needed. In [braiins' description of stratum v2 job negotiation](https://braiins.com/blog/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization), I don't see anywhere where a bitcoin protocol change would be necessary. Could you clarify?

Also, if you work for Braiins, I wanted to mention that its SUPER annoying that the subscribe popup comes up every 60 seconds. Even after you subscribe, it keeps coming up. Please fix that if you work there.

A separate question: I've heard job negotiation is optional when using V2. Is that true? Why not make job negotiation a requirement of v2 (once it becomes possible)?",,,,,,,,2021-03-10,04:27:38

Now when you look up at the sun, there's lots and lots of photons coming off that, but they just warm the ground around you for the most part.

What you want to do is turn the rock into something that can collect photons and use that energy to move electrons. And FINALLY bitcoin helps you pay for that conversion.

Important things to note is Bitcoin can easily be net zero if ran on renewables and could replace gold which emits more CO2 and is environmentally destructive.

Where do you think the Doge in Dogecoin came from? This subreddit was created and dedicated to the Meme much longer before Dogecoin was ever even thought of. 

***

EDIT 2: A lot of questions I've answered ask ""What is /r/doge about if not about Dogecoin?""

The answer is that /r/doge is about the original Doge meme that the cryptocurrency was inspired from, and /r/dogecoin, which most of you are looking for, is the subreddit for all things Dogecoin-related. That's what the title of this post means: /r/doge and /r/dogecoin have always been separate. Just because /r/dogecoin uses ""doge"" as a ticker **does not** mean that /r/doge is the Dogecoin subreddit.

***

EDIT: The subreddit is now in manual approval mode due to the increase in Dogecoin spam.
