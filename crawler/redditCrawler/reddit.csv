109,Hey guys question about BlockFi risk vs reward. Is earning 6% on BTC with monthly compounded interest worth the risk of holding in a company that doesn’t have guaranteed insurance?,,,,,,,
110,"1. If big institutions are putting large amounts of BTC on the books as a store of value, similar to gold and usd, will that reduce the volatility of BTC in the long run? 

2. Following this line of thinking, could BTC establish an inverse relationship with the stock markets?

3. This stimulus package is different that the 2020. This stimulus aimed at households with less than 80k per year. Whereas, last spring the bulk went to large firms and the FIRE sector. There was also a burst of QE in the spring. QE is continuing in the US, Canada, and the EU at a slower pace. Although, it could easily be ramped up again if there were shocks, even short term, to the economy or markets. In the short to medium term its inflationary, yes, but also ensuring profitability and a buffer. These are conditions ripe for institutional  investment. 

I don't think that these stimulus dollars will be flowing from households into crypto or the stock market at nearly the same volume. Households at those income deciles have a much larger propensity to spend and lower propensity to save. Between 0% and 10% is the savings or alternatively the potential investment rate for the households receiving stimulus [note: paying down debt is is considered ""saving"" and the household debt to GDP ratio is very high, with <80k households having the bulk of the debt burden.]. Conversely, they consume a greater share of their income, between 90% and 100%. I see this stimulus money increasing aggregate demand (particularly for durable goods), which increases the employment rate, capacity utilization and other economic indicators that give business and investors confidence in the overall market, including cryptocurrencies. 

Psychologically, if the investment community believes this stimulus will substantially increase the cryptocurrency market cap it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. This stimulus package is also an indication that Biden will continue spending and stimulating the economy. Not to mention he was in the administration that gave out ""golden parachutes"" and went to bat for bondholders abroad following the 2008 crisis. Using the moral hazard argument, it's reasonable to assume that the financial sector and large firms will factor that into their longterm plans. Which encourages taking on cheap debt, stock buy backs, and other activities which spur the markets upwards. Of course, there are downsides and inherent risk that the crypto community is familiar with. 

I see the same outcome, but for very different  reasons. 

No one else is saying this that I've seen, but it's what makes sense to me. So, my question is this, am I on to something or am I missing something?",,,,,,,

edit: I suppose I was asking with cloud storage in mind. I know any type of online storage is extremely ill-advised, but with a layer or two of obfuscation and an unexpected file format... maybe the risks are diminished? 

Paper or steel are obviously great in their simplicity and security, but would typically be stored among other items of value (in a safe, etc.)

And in a hypothetical 'bug-out' situation where, for whatever reason, you may be restricted from even accessing that safe ever again? Then what?

131,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview & Progress Update,14,m16uon,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m16uon/decentralizationboosting_mining_protocol_stratum/,5,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap & update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 & BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/upgrade\/compare-mining-protocols](https://preview.redd.it/lfabnz5z30m61.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0deab79ca092c68515e9c8af5f5492c88c4f1b6)

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners & mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

>[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

>""[Bitcoin’s Decentralization with Stratum V2](https://braiins.com/blog/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization)""

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",1615326884.0

This community always talks about HODLing forever, but Here's how I think about it now:  If its something that I love or something I need, I would consider spending bitcoin.  I treat it like my savings/retirement.  If I had a financial emergency, or a necessary expense that I could not cover with my normal income, I would consider selling some bitcoin to cover it.    If my employer paid me in BTC, my spending habits would probably look a little differently (I would probably spend even less on things that aren't necessary), but I already try to take that approach, and any unbudgeted money at the end of the month gets stored in BTC as a much safer store of value than fiat currency like USD or euro.   Looking back, I regret the times I spent BTC on trivial things because now that BTC value could have been enough to fund non profit orgs that I love, and retire comfortably.     When you believe BTC is the best possible store of monetary energy, it doesn't make sense to trade it for anything else if retaining/growing value is the goal.

Now the one-millionth part of the Bitcoin supply is worth $ 1 million.*

**Anyone who owns 21 bitcoins, or one millionth of the total supply, is a millionaire today.**

https://preview.redd.it/lwe5w4haqzl61.jpg?width=2300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8f6eb374315493f477bb1014cbaf59107116364

Back in 2017, financial publications announced the emergence of a group of crypto enthusiasts “hunting” for exclusive membership in the “[*21 Million Club*](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-21-million-club-more-exclusive-by-the-day-2017-12)”. Also over the past years, there have been many forum posts about people who have finally ended up in the exclusive club of owners who own one bitcoin (BTC). The r / Bitcoin subreddit has [a whole topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q8uv3/owning_1_btc_is_slowly_getting_out_of_reach_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) dedicated to those wishing to accumulate 1 bitcoin.

*Each member of the 21 million club who owns one BTC now owns exactly 0.0000047619% of the total BTC supply*.

Members of another club of crypto millionaires, who managed to collect 21 BTC or 0.0000999999% of the total limited supply of bitcoins, join [the 21-BTC CLUB](https://21-btc.club/). Membership in the club is informal and symbolic. Club members are recommended the best crypto wallets, among which Trezor is in the first place, the best exchanges, they teach how to pay taxes correctly and share the best information resources on the topic.

*Many people ask why Satoshi Nakamoto chose the 21 million Bitcoin emission limit?* There are many versions.

For example, Ph.D. Christian Seberino explained in 2018 that Satoshi most likely chose 21 million in order to “use floating point arithmetic.” You can read more about this [here](https://medium.com/@cseberino/why-21-million-bitcoins-was-a-great-idea-bd2533af0f63).

However, according to e-mail correspondence between Mike Hearn and Nakamoto, the inventor of bitcoin has chosen a limit of 21 million to match the M1 money supply of fiat currencies such as the euro and the US dollar. Back in 2008, when Nakamoto published the White Paper, the M1 money supply was roughly $ 21 trillion. By simple calculations, we get the predicted Bitcoin price of $ 1 million by Satoshi Nakamoto.

“*I wanted to choose something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but not knowing the future, it is very difficult. I ended up choosing something in between”,* Nakamoto said in an email to Hearn.

Summarizing all this information, we can assume that even **owning 0.1 BTC will make any person a dollar millionaire during his lifetime**. Not to mention the fact that having collected 21 bitcoins, a person will automatically enter the 1% of the richest people on the planet.",1615319278.0

474,Goldman Sachs says high BTC returns in 2021 will destroy everything on Wall Street,155,m13ptx,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m13ptx/goldman_sachs_says_high_btc_returns_in_2021_will/,30,"It was not until the end of January that Goldman Sachs compared BTC with global assets. Nevertheless, since 2021, the rate of return of BTC has been twice that of the energy industry.

&#x200B;

In January, Goldman Sachs, a well-known Wall Street investment company, began to include Bitcoin in its weekly global asset class return rankings. That month, BTC quietly climbed to the top of the rankings.

&#x200B;

But since then, BTC's advantages have expanded relative to assets such as stocks, bonds, oil, gold, bank stocks, technology stocks, and the euro.

&#x200B;

In its latest U.S. Weekly Kickstart report, Goldman Sachs Group showed that as of March 4, the return rate of BTC was about 70%, followed by the energy industry with a return rate of 35%.

&#x200B;

The U.S. stock market has recently sold off, and the return of the S&P 500 index is currently close to zero. In contrast, the advantage of BTC is even more obvious.

&#x200B;

1. For cyclical industries such as energy and finance, the rebound in oil prices and the increase in real interest rates have pushed up the current rate of return, but the performance is still inferior to BTC.

&#x200B;

2. At present, the risk-adjusted capital return rate of crude oil and energy is higher than that of BTC.

&#x200B;

3. Gold is the worst-performing asset class so far this year, because traditional defensive industries such as consumer daily necessities and public utilities have been affected due to rising real interest rates.

&#x200B;

4. According to previous CoinDesk reports, in cryptocurrency and traditional markets, many investors believe that BTC is a potential inflation hedging tool, especially now that central banks around the world have issued a large number of additional issuances to boost the economy affected by the new crown virus. Even so, from the beginning of the year to now, the price of gold has fallen by about 10%, so some market observers believe that BTC is eating away at the gold market share.

&#x200B;

5. According to a survey, approximately 40% of Goldman Sachs customers have invested in cryptocurrencies.

&#x200B;

6. Even so, in May 2020, Goldman Sachs' asset management department stated in a statement that for customers, cryptocurrency is not a suitable investment, driven by speculation behind it, and is more famous than the notorious Dutch tulip in the 17th century. The bubble is even crazier.",1615314382.0

Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt,” it said.

The answer is that /r/doge is about the original Doge meme that the cryptocurrency was inspired from, and /r/dogecoin, which most of you are looking for, is the subreddit for all things Dogecoin-related. That's what the title of this post means: /r/doge and /r/dogecoin have always been separate.
